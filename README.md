## Project Overview:

The project No.6 of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree with Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also, a service worker was added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## How to run / Installation:

  * Download ZIP or clone the repo using git: [https://github.com/dastinadamowski/restaurant-review-app.git](https://github.com/dastinadamowski/restaurant-review-app.git).
  * Navigate to a location where you unzipped the file or cloned the repository.
  * In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
  In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
  With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the app looks like.

  OR if you don't want to use python:

  * In this folder, open Git Bash, type `http-server` and visit the site given, i.e. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Dependencies

 * This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
 * HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6
 * Many thanks to the [Udacity team](https://eu.udacity.com/), [MDN Community](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) as well as [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for precious resources, invaluable yet free-of-charge knowledge and for proving that programming can be fun, a big driver of change and a spectacularly limitless tool.

--> Thank you for using this app!
